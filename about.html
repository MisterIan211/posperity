            <p>Tools Used for The Data Collection</p>

            <p>Surveys: This popular method allows you to reach a large number of businesses relatively quickly and
                efficiently.
                Design a survey instrument to gather data on: Specific pain points they experience with their current
                transaction processes (e.g., time spent manually entering data, errors in transactions, difficulty
                tracking
                inventory)</p>

            <p>Industry reports: Consult reports from business associations, economic think tanks, or research
                institutions that
                analyze trends and factors contributing to business failure within specific industries.</p>

            <p>Social media listening: Track online conversations on platforms like Twitter or Reddit using tools like
                Sprout
                Social to understand public sentiment and emerging themes related to business struggles.</p>

            <p>Research Ethics</p>

            <p>I would remove any names, addresses, and other identifying information from data before analysis.</p>

            <p>I would develop consent forms that are easy to understand and accessible to all participants.</p>

            <p>Storing data securely and not sharing it with third parties without consent</p>

            <p>Regularly reviewing my research methods and procedures to ensure that they are ethical and compliant with
                regulations.</p>

            <p>Involving different perspectives e.g. different team members in the research process</p>

            <p>Assigning participants with unique identifiers to anonymize their data, and any identifying information
                will be
                removed or encrypted to protect their privacy.</p>

            <p>Participants will be given sufficient time to review the information and ask any questions they may have
                before
                deciding whether to participate.</p>

            <p>Participants will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without
                penalty or
                consequence.</p>

            <p>Participants will be assured of their anonymity throughout the research process, meaning that their
                identity will
                not be disclosed in any way.</p>
